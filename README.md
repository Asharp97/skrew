# 🎮 Skrew – Real-Time Multiplayer Game Backend

**Skrew** is a fast-paced online multiplayer game built as a clone of an existing classic, reimagined with a modern backend architecture.  
The project demonstrates my ability to design scalable, real-time systems using **GraphQL**, **NestJS**, and **WebSockets**.  

---

## 🚀 Why Skrew?

In today’s gaming world, performance and scalability are everything. Skrew is not just a game clone—it’s a **tech showcase** of how to build a robust backend for real-time multiplayer experiences.  

- ⚡ **Real-time gameplay** powered by WebSockets  
- 🕹️ **Seamless matchmaking** for online players  
- 🔒 **Secure and scalable backend** using NestJS  
- 🧩 **GraphQL API** for flexible data querying and future-proof integrations  
- 🌍 **Built for scale** – the architecture can support more players and more features  

If you’re looking for an engineer who can build **complex, production-ready systems** that balance fun and performance—this is a glimpse of what I can deliver.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)  
- **API**: [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)  
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets  
- **Database**: *(add what you used here – e.g. PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)*  
- **Auth & Session Management**: *(add if applicable)*

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js (>=16)**
* **npm** or **yarn**

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/asharp97/skrew.git

cd skrew

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start development server
npm run start:dev
```

By default, the server runs at:
👉 [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) for the GraphQL Playground.

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. Players connect to the server via WebSockets.
2. Matchmaking pairs players in real-time.
3. Game state is synced across all connected clients instantly.
4. GraphQL queries provide player stats, game history, and more.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

* 🔧 **Scalable Architecture**: Built with NestJS modules for maintainability.
* 📡 **Real-Time State Syncing**: Ensures all players see the same game state with minimal lag.
* 📊 **Analytics-Ready**: Extendable with GraphQL to track matches, scores, and players.
* 🚀 **Portfolio-Ready**: A project designed to showcase skills in **backend engineering for games**.
